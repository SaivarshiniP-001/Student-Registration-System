# Student-Registration-System
This is a simple GUI modelwhich was created in Python using tkinter library. Initially, a database was created in MySQL Workbench and then a code in Python using tkinter was executed in Jypter. 

Programming Language used is Python
Connectivity API used is PyMySQL
Connection String: pymysql.connect(host=’localhost’, user=’root’, password=’***********’',
  database=’database_name’)
  Reason for Using Python: Python was chosen for its simplicity, ease of use, and availability of
  libraries like Tkinter and PyMySQL. It provided me a straightforward way to develop graphical
 user interfaces and interact with databases.

 This simple GUI model does student registration operations such as inserting student details, modifying Student details, deleting student records and adding new student record.
